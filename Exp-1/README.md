## Learning Outcomes: SPA vs MPA (Basic)

- **Single Page Applications (SPAs) load once and update content dynamically**  
  SPAs load the page only one time and update content without refreshing the whole page.

- **Multi Page Applications (MPAs) reload pages on every action**  
  In MPAs, each click or navigation loads a new page from the server.

- **SPAs provide a smoother user experience**  
  Since SPAs do not reload the full page, they feel faster and more interactive.

- **MPAs are simpler for beginners to build and understand**  
  MPAs use basic HTML pages and server-side navigation, making them beginner-friendly.

- **Both SPAs and MPAs are chosen based on project requirements**  
  SPAs are commonly used for web applications, while MPAs are used for traditional websites.
